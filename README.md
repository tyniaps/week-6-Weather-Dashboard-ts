Server-Side APIs

## Description

The Weather Dashboard was created during further exploration into the topic of APIs, more specifically, Server Side APIs.

Previous exploration of Web APIs and Third Party APIs highlighted the ways in which JavaScript can be used outside of the browser. Some key learning topics included the manipulation of CSS and HTML elements via JavaScript, with the jQuery library available for more efficient DOM traversal. 

Building on from the exploration of these topics, the Weather Dashboard challenge served as an introduction to the Request-Response Model and the Javascript methods that are used to retrieve data from servers. 

Some key learning topics include the use of the "fetch" method and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
